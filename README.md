>Overview
During the course of my internship, I gained hands-on experience in core Machine Learning algorithms and data analysis techniques. The primary focus areas were:

Linear Regression

Implemented simple and multiple linear regression models using Python (NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn).

Understood concepts like cost function, gradient descent, RÂ² score, and residuals.

Applied the model to real-world datasets (e.g., housing prices, salary prediction).

Logistic Regression

Learned binary and multiclass classification.

Explored sigmoid function, decision boundaries, and confusion matrix.

Evaluated model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Cleaned and preprocessed raw datasets (handling nulls, duplicates, outliers).

Used visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand data patterns.

Conducted feature correlation, trend analysis, and hypothesis testing.
